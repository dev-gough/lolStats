# League of legends stats project

To run for yourself, simply clone the repo, ensure there is no 'challenges.db' file in the folder, then change the `NAME` variable in `main.py` to whatever summoner name you want to track.

(preferrably create a venv)
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, simply execute `./python3 main.py` and wait! Play a leauge game, and it will see the challenges updated, and tell you by how much.
